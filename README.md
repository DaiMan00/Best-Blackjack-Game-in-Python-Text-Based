# Best-Blackjack-Game-in-Python-Text-Based-

This Blackjack game allows one player to play with the dealer(computer).

Assume the dealer has one card upside down, the player and dealer will receive two cards at first. 

The player chooses to 'hit' or 'stand', and assuming the player is playing rationally, the player should 'stand' if sum of hand is >= 12 and 'hit' only when sum of hand <= 11.
